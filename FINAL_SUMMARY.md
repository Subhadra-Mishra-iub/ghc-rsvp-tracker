## 💡 Project Inspiration (For Interviews)

> "As an attendee of Grace Hopper Celebration 2025, I found myself overwhelmed by the sheer number of company after-hours events, networking sessions, and tech meetups happening throughout the conference. Keeping track of which events I wanted to attend, which ones I'd already RSVP'd to, and which companies I'd engaged with became a challenge. I needed a simple, lightweight tool that could help me stay organized without the complexity of full-featured calendar applications or event management platforms. This project was born from that practical need - a personal event organizer that's fast, beautiful, and works entirely in the browser with no backend required. It's designed to be something I can quickly access on my phone during the conference, update on the go, and share with other attendees who face the same challenge."
